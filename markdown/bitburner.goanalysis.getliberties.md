## GoAnalysis.getLiberties() method

Returns a number for each point, representing how many open nodes its network/chain is connected to. Empty nodes and dead nodes are shown as -1 liberties.

For example, a 5x5 board might look like this. The chain in the top-left touches 5 total empty nodes, and the one in the center touches four. The group in the bottom-right only has one liberty; it is in danger of being captured!

```js
[
  [-1, 5,-1,-1, 2],
  [ 5, 5,-1,-1,-1],
  [-1,-1, 4,-1,-1],
  [ 3,-1,-1, 3, 1],
  [ 3,-1,-1, 3, 1],
]
```

**Signature:**

```typescript
getLiberties(): number[][];
```
**Returns:**

number\[\]\[\]
